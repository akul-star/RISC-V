# RISC-V
RISC-V (pronounced "risk-five") is an open-source instruction set architecture (ISA) for computer processors. An instruction set architecture is a set of instructions that a processor can execute, defining the interface between software and hardware. RISC-V is designed to be simple, modular, and extensible.
